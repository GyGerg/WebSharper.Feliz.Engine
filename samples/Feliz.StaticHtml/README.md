# Feliz.StaticHtml

Proof-of-concept for using F# and [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/) to generate static HTML. This example uses Fable for faster incremental compilation, but it would be easy to adapt it for a .NET server as it doesn't rely on any JS dependency like React. To test, run: `npm i && npm start`
